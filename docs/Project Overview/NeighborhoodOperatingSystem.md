A __*Neighborhood Operating System*__ (`nOS`) is any web application that includes custom tools and functionality designed to increase the well-being of a group of residents. The ThrivingPark `nOS` leverages the expert knowledge of our volunteer developers, designers, and User Experience researchers to develop simple online tools to make life in [Driving Park](DrivingPark.md) more equitable, healthy, and happy.

## How do you decide what to build?

That's the easy part: __*we don't!*__

We should never and will never prescribe our view of what would enhance the lives of Driving Parks residents and families. Only the folks living and working in the community can do that. The feature development lifecycle for ThrivingPark follows 4 steps designed to maximize community input and engagement:

1. __*Ask the Community*__ - People are smart. They will tell you what they want and need. You just have to ask!
2. __*Create designs for features based on what the community wants*__- Don't assume that you've got it right the first time. Ask again!
3. __*Present those desings to the community and refactor based on their feedback*__ - Iteration leads to innovation!
4. __*Develop the feature*__ - Continuous delivery to maximize community benefit!

The residents of Driving Park are our users and our only stakeholders. We "work" for them and want to deliver the tools and functionality that they suggest. Our only goal is to share our collective know-how bring the neighborhood's great ideas to life!
